# Pomodoro Timer

A small, personal pomodoro timer I hacked together during my bachelors thesis to help myself stay productive.

It's a minimal desktop app with a simple GUI (built with `tkinter`) that lets you alternate between work and break phases â€” with sound notifications and customizable timings.  
I built this mainly for myself.

You may need to install ``pygame`` and ``psutil``

To start the timer, simply use:
````bash
python pomodoro.py
````
